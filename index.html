    <h4>
        Qizai is a brown and white giant panda who is known for being the only known captive brown panda in the world. He lives in the Foping Panda Valley in Shaanxi province, China, where he has become a local celebrity and a popular tourist attraction.
    
        Qizai's unique coloring is the result of a genetic mutation that causes his fur to be brown instead of the usual black and white pattern of most pandas. This mutation is very rare, and Qizai is one of only a few brown pandas ever recorded in the wild.
        
        Despite his unusual appearance, Qizai is a typical giant panda in many ways. He loves to eat bamboo, and he spends most of his time lounging and sleeping. He is also quite shy and tends to avoid human contact, although he has become more accustomed to his keepers and the visitors who come to see him.
        
        Qizai's unique coloring has made him an important ambassador for giant panda conservation. He has helped to raise awareness about the plight of this endangered species, which is threatened by habitat loss, poaching, and other human activities. Through his popularity, Qizai has helped to inspire people around the world to take action to protect pandas and their habitat.
        
        Are there any other unique or rare panda species?
        
        There are no other species of pandas, but there are subspecies of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), which is the only species of panda. The giant panda is classified as a vulnerable species, with an estimated population of around 1,800 individuals in the wild.
        
        One subspecies of the giant panda is the Qinling panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis), which is found only in the Qinling Mountains of Shaanxi province in China. The Qinling panda is smaller and has a shorter skull and smaller teeth than other giant pandas. It also has a different coloration, with a darker coat and smaller black patches around the eyes, ears, and legs. The Qinling panda is considered a critically endangered subspecies, with an estimated population of less than 300 individuals in the wild.
        
        Another subspecies of the giant panda is the Amdo panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis), which is found in the northeastern region of the Tibetan Plateau. The Amdo panda is also smaller than other giant pandas and has distinct physical features, such as a narrow skull and longer jaw. However, there is still debate among scientists about whether the Amdo panda should be considered a separate subspecies or just a regional variant of the giant panda.
        
        It's worth noting that the brown and white coloration of Qizai, the panda I mentioned earlier, is not a distinct subspecies of the giant panda. It is just a rare genetic mutation that can occur in any population of giant pandas.
